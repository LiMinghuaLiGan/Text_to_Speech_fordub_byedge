0
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,570
The place that we saw her for the first time is the relics of Asshai.

1
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,790
At that time, the power of our suppressors was insufficient.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,340
We fell at the door of the relic

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,570
She's the one who saved us.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,370
Although not so gentle

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,560
The target has been captured

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:16,980
Take him/her away.

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,718
Execute the memory erasure program

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,230
Hello,everyone.

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,380
I'm Xiaofeng.

10
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,590
In this issue, we will get to know Frigg, the eldest sister next door.

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,260
When we wake up,

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,774
It was already in Sing Tao, and the predators come to attacked.

13
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,360
ShirLi mutated unfortunately in order to protect her brother.

14
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,860
We were commissioned by ZeKe to find Frigg.

15
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,260
But what a coincidence.

16
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,620
She's not in the lab.

17
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,700
We accidentally triggered the system.

18
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:44,790
She replied: "when you visit, you should at least choose when the host is at home."

19
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,180
"Sorry.

20
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,400
I'm here to deliver a message.

21
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,230
I didn't mean to go through your stuff. "

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,800
"stranger, please explain why you are here."

23
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,630
Obviously proudly say that we are strangers

24
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,394
Finally, she gently agreed to the request. Then when we go back to Sing Tao.

25
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,070
Things are out of control.

26
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,870
ZeKe also made a decision.

27
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,300
Obviously he don't like the Heirs of Aida.

28
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,220
But he had to go back for her sister.

29
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,600
Actually, he should know.

30
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,750
What the Sage wants is the key in his hand.

31
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,380
The set of keys

32
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,680
was given to him by his father, Hank

33
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,130
Although I don't know what to do.

34
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,026
But I also acquiesced in their departure.

35
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,810
When we catch up again,

36
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,140
Frigg is already standing there.

37
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,430
Red hair symbolizes the flame and the light of the Heirs of Aida.

38
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:32,780
Although the body has been transformed into a machine

39
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,346
But it doesn't hinder their inner firmness.

40
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,789
She's here to pick up ZeKe.

41
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:39,030
Franz also chased here.

42
00:01:39,030him 00:01:41,570
But we still couldn't keep them.

43
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,750
So we had to set out to the port of Bengis.

44
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,940
It was Praying for Life Festival when I saw her again.

45
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:51,660
Fireworks was all over the sky in Bengis.

46
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,916
But she had no time to appreciate it and hurried by with ZeKe.

47
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,030
We snuck past.

48
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,990
Unexpectedly, we were discovered.

49
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,820
Stop hiding.

50
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,620
Kid, come out and show your face.

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,290
She's still so gentle.

52
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,645
But we had to fight her.

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,400
It's obvious

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,340
Great disparity in strength

55
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,890
We were defeated.

56
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,620
She didn't kill us.

57
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,918
But let's be polite next time.

58
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,210
I don't hate you.

59
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:28,314
But next time you ask a question, remember to be polite.

60
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,480
After another long journey, we came to Moby Dick Island.

61
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,140
She stood aloof in front of the merry-go-round.

62
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,880
there is a feeling of not daring to approach.

63
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,390
We tried to help ZeKe, but he refused.

64
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,640
Is he looking down on our strength?

65
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:42,410
Not really.

66
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,788
He hates us who work for Hykros.

67
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,230
His father was forced to death by Hykros.

68
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,329
The mother also killed herself.

69
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,740
They are not qualified parents.

70
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,456
Leave ZeKe and his sister depend on each other.

71
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,790
After all these years,

72
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,526
Maybe he didn't really trust anyone.

73
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,310
Frigga struck and subdued us with one blow

74
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,780
But she still didn't hurt us.

75
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,930
This woman is supposed to be our enemy.

76
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,840
But let us go again and again.

77
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,930
Thanks to her help on Miyu Island.

78
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,368
But after curing ShirLi, ZeKe left again.

79
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,840
At this point, ZeKe seems to be starting to believe us.

80
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:22,350
"Thank you.

81
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,476
But after that, I don't want to involve you. "

82
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,760
When we came to Wallan,

83
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,000
I saw her again.

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,750
We had just been defeated by Hill.

85
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,680
She saved us again.

86
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,310
And left as aloof as ever.

87
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,230
She really looks like a big sister.

88
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,579
Heared that she loves car racing.

89
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,298
Maybe only speed can make her forget her loneliness.

90
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:48,150
Heard that she was picked up by the Sage.

91
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,610
On the verge of death

92
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,570
At the time of losing everything

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,510
When there is nothing left

94
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,570
Maybe that's why she's so loyal to the Sage.

95
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,260
She must hate the world, too.

96
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,470
The world that took everything away from her.

97
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,140
But when I see her again,

98
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,180
She stood at the top of the mountain

99
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,169
The Sage is not dead.

100
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,090
They're also watching Vera.

101
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,868
But it is clear that their purpose is different from ours.

102
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,438
She seems to want to open up this time.

103
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,149
She said

104
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:19,940
the Heirs of Aida is also for the good of the world.

105
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,610
Just in an extreme way.

106
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,800
the protagonist seem to understand her.

107
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,090
But I still don't understand why she let the protagonist go again and again.

108
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,160
Is it because the protagonist have nothing?

109
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,630
Is it because the protagonist showed her who she used to be?

110
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,850
No parents.

111
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,860
No relatives.

112
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,900
Even no memory.

113
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,590
But the protagonist wants to help others and save the world on the verge of destruction.

114
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,530
The abyss of disorder is about to be opened.

115
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,298
I hope to see her again.

116
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,600
Frigg, the eldest sister next door

117
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,300
That's all for this issue.

118
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,596
